/**
 * Memory Store Abstraction Layer — Core Types & Interfaces.
 *
 * This module defines the storage contracts that all backend implementations
 * (SQLite local, Tencent Cloud VectorDB, etc.) must satisfy.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * 1. **Backend-agnostic**: Upper-layer modules (hooks, tools, pipeline, record)
 *    depend only on these interfaces — never on concrete implementations.
 * 2. **Capability-based**: Features like vector search, FTS, and hybrid search
 *    are expressed as capability flags so callers can gracefully degrade.
 * 3. **Fault-tolerant**: All methods return empty results or `false` on
 *    failure rather than throwing, unless explicitly documented otherwise.
 * 4. **Sync-first**: Matches current SQLite DatabaseSync usage. TCVDB backend
 *    adapts internally without changing these signatures.
