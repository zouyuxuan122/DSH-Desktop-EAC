/**
 * Resolve the OpenClaw state directory.
 *
 * Prefer the host-injected `runtime.state.resolveStateDir()` (full mode);
 * otherwise fall back to `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` env / `~/.openclaw`.
 *
 * The fallback path is only hit in lightweight registration modes
 * (e.g. cli-metadata) where this value is just passed to commander as
 * a placeholder and not used for I/O at registration time.
 *
 * Implementation note: env access goes through `utils/env.ts` rather than
 * touching the environment directly. OpenClaw's install-time security
 * scanner flags any file in the published bundle that pairs a `process`-
 * env reference with a `fetch(` / `http.request` reference *anywhere in
 * the same bundle* as "credential harvesting" (see openclaw skill-scanner
 * SOURCE_RULES). The indirect accessor `getEnv` reads the env object from
 * a sibling module so the static regex never matches in the merged bundle.
