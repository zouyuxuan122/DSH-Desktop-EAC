/**
 * AgentTeams for DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * A host-plane plugin that registers the `agent_teams_*` tools and one usage
 * section into the global system prompt. After installation any session can
 * run multi-agent teamwork through natural language (e.g. "use AgentTeams to research X"):
 * the model creates a team (it becomes the captain), spawns members as
 * durable continuable subagents, breaks the goal into tasks with
 * dependencies, wakes members with messages, relays reports, and collects
 * results.
 *
 * Installation (bundle): `dsh plugin --profile <name> add @nanmicoder/dsh-agent-teams`
 * (or a local path). The bundle patch mounts this plugin row into the host
 * composition; the tools register into the shared `tools` registry and the
 * usage section into the global system prompt, so the plugin needs no realm.
 *
 * @module dsh-agent-teams
